\abstract{ \textbf{Motivation:} With the rapidly growing amount of
  data acquired by high-throughput sequencing technologies,
  combined with a growing body of phenotype data from medical and
  experimental biology, computing correlation coefficients is a
  recurring bottleneck. This bottleneck is amplified in the
  presence of missing data.\\
\textbf{Results:} Here we present a novel high performance,
  robust, Matrix Pearson Correlation Coefficient (MPCC) algorithm that
  greatly reduces the bottleneck associated with the PCC calculation
  with any amount of missing data. Our method is a reformulation of
  the standard PCC algorithm where the lion's share of MPCC
  is handled by fast matrix-matrix products and element-wise matrix
  operations.  On a single Intel Xeon Gold 6148 $@$ $2.4$ GHz
  (Skylake) CPU our algorithm achieves 4.3 TFlop/s in single precision
  (i.e., $77\%$ of the theoretical peak). We show how MPCC outperforms
  the existing implementation in R by around $200$-fold. \\

\section{Introduction}

The use of Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) is ubiquitous across all
fields of biology ranging from agriculture to zoology. Large-scale
computation of correlations are found in many areas of biology and
bioinformatics.  For example, genotype-genotype correlations are
used to construct haplotypes, build genetic maps, and order markers
within the genome. Pearson correlations are also used in
co-expression analysis \citep{Tesson:2010}, (genome wide)
association analysis \citep{Cichonska:2016}, reconstruction of genetic
networks \citep{Fukushima:2013}, weighted correlation network analysis
(WGCNA) \citep{Horvath:2008} and correlated trait locus (CTL)
mapping \citep{Arends2016a}.

\enlargethispage{12pt}

The work presented here is motivated by GeneNetwork, a service for
web-based genetics \citep{Sloan2016} which routinely performs PCC
calculations to find relationships between and among genotypes and
phenotypes. These calculations are a bottleneck with
moderate to large problem sizes.

The BXD family is a panel of 150 recombinant inbred mouse lines
derived from parents C57BL/6J and DBA/2J \citep{Ashbrook:2019}. The
BXD data collection in GeneNetwork consists of high-density genotypes
with 7,000 classical phenotypes and over 120 independent data sets
containing between 20,000 to 1.2 million gene expression phenotypes. A
typical example is computing PCC within and between sets of gene
expression phenotypes.

Statistics are often computed in the R language for statistical computing
\citep{R:2005}. R's default $cor()$ implementation of PCC is written in C.
While R's version is relatively performant on complete data, it is
notably slow when handling missing data. Also, the default option to
remove individuals with missing phenotype or genotype data, is not
suitable for most biological data sets. In GeneNetwork, for example,
most experiments use different subsets of the available 150 BXD
lines. A multi-experiment PCC computation based on removing rows with
missing phenotypes would end up being empty.

With MPCC we implemented a novel matrix based approach for PCC
computation that acts as a drop-in replacement for R's default $cor()$
function and can handle missing data without loss of performance.

  visualized with error bars - i.e. these show that missing data
  handled by MPCC bit-masking has limited effect on performance.

\section{Approach}

In the first iteration we started optimizing the speed at which
correlations are computed by writing a version that is algorithmically
identical to the R $cor()$ function (Supplement 1 and 2). Next, OpenMP
multi-threading support was added which provided limited speedup,
typically in the order of 3.5$\times$ compared to the single core
version.

In the next iteration, we wrote MPCC, an implementation of PCC that
can leverage the advantages offered by any math library that is
optimized for matrix-based operations, such as Intel’s Math Kernel
Library (MKL), IBM’s Engineering and Scientific Subroutine Library
(ESSL) and the AMD Core Math Library (ACML). With OpenBlas this
approach sped up computations up to $200\times$ on a 28-core machine
(Fig. \ref{fig:fig1}).  MPCC reformulates the original algorithm into
a series of matrix-matrix products and element-wise matrix operations
(Supplement 3 - 'The Matrix Version').

MPCC handles missing data by using a novel bit-masking approach that
leverages existing matrix-matrix multiplication implementations from,
for example, OpenBLAS (Supplement 4 - 'Missing Data Bit-masking').

To benchmark MPCC on a real-world problem pairwise correlation between
genotypes of the BXD family were computed. Genotype data in the BXD
family is complete with only a few heterozygous or 'missing' loci
remaining, i.e., it benchmarks MPCC versus $cor()$ when only a small amount
of data is missing (Supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore, speed improvement of MPCC
versus R's $cor()$ were computed using randomly generated phenotype matrices.
We step-wise increased the size of the matrices as well as the amount of
missing data. Even on a single core MPCC showed a \textasciitilde{}$5$-fold
speedup compared to the $cor()$ function provided in R. With multi-threading
MPCC gains with every core added, up to \textasciitilde{}$200$-fold in our
tests (Fig. \ref{fig:fig1}).

MPCC can be installed as an R package. MPCC is written in C$++$, and
provides a foreign function interface (FFI). MPCC can therefore be
called from any other computer language using FFI. The source
repository includes an FFI binding for the R programming language
which can act as an example for other programming languages.

\section{Discussion}

MPCC is a reimplementation of the original PCC algorithm using matrix-matrix
multiplication and element-wise matrix operations. MPCC makes use of
multi-threading and modern vector extensions of CPU hardware. The missing
data bit-masking approach can handle missing data without loss of performance,
and can be generalized to other algorithms which rely on matrix-matrix multiplication.

MPCC as well as the missing data bit-masking approach were recently
ported to run on a GPU. The GPU implementation is available using the
FFI, and will be made available from the R package.

With this work we not only introduce a faster routine that reduces
regularly occurring bottlenecks in large-scale correlation computations, but
also show that it can pay off to revisit 'obvious' implementations
of routines in common use today that were written over 20 years
ago. Computer hardware and architecture is still changing and
dedicated optimization work may benefit both interactivity for
end-users and large-scale computations on high-perfomance compute
clusters at the same time.
