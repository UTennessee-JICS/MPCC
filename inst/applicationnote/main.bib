@article{Tesson:2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large microarray datasets have enabled gene regulation to be studied through coexpression analysis. While numerous methods have been developed for identifying differentially expressed genes between two conditions, the field of differential coexpression analysis is still relatively new. More specifically, there is so far no sensitive and untargeted method to identify gene modules (also known as gene sets or clusters) that are differentially coexpressed between two conditions. Here, sensitive and untargeted means that the method should be able to construct de novo modules by grouping genes based on shared, but subtle, differential correlation patterns. RESULTS: We present DiffCoEx, a novel method for identifying correlation pattern changes, which builds on the commonly used Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) framework for coexpression analysis. We demonstrate its usefulness by identifying biologically relevant, differentially coexpressed modules in a rat cancer dataset. CONCLUSIONS: DiffCoEx is a simple and sensitive method to identify gene coexpression differences between multiple conditions.},

@article{Fukushima:2013,
abstract = {Large-scale "omics" data, such as microarrays, can be used to infer underlying cellular regulatory networks in organisms, enabling us to better understand the molecular basis of disease and important traits. Correlation approaches, such as a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2 experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the DiffCorr package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. DiffCorr calculates correlation matrices for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based "eigen-molecules" in the correlation networks, and tests differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks. DiffCorr can explore differential correlations between 2 conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely transcriptomics and metabolomics. DiffCorr is simple to use in calculating differential correlations and is suitable for the first step towards inferring causal relationships and detecting biomarker candidates. The package can be downloaded from the following website: http://diffcorr.sourceforge.net/.},

abstract = {The Gene Expression Database (GXD; www.informatics.jax.org/expression.shtml) is an extensive and well-curated community resource of mouse developmental expression information. Through curation of the scientific literature and by collaborations with large-scale expression projects, GXD collects and integrates data from RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, northern blot and western blot experiments. Expression data from both wild-type and mutant mice are included. The expression data are combined with genetic and phenotypic data in Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) and made readily accessible to many types of database searches. At present, GXD includes over 1.5 million expression results and more than 300 000 images, all annotated with detailed and standardized metadata. Since our last report in 2014, we have added a large amount of data, we have enhanced data and database infrastructure, and we have implemented many new search and display features. Interface enhancements include: a new Mouse Developmental Anatomy Browser; interactive tissue-by-developmental stage and tissue-by-gene matrix views; capabilities to filter and sort expression data summaries; a batch search utility; gene-based expression overviews; and links to expression data from other species.},
