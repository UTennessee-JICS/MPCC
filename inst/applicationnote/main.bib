abstract = {BLAS is a fundamental math library in scientific computing. Thus, each CPU vendor releases optimized BLAS library for its own CPU. Loongson CPU series are developed by the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2010, it released Loongson 3 CPU series. This paper introduces the open source BLAS library OpenBLAS, which is forked on GotoBLAS 2-1.13 BSD version. BLAS Level 3 functions of OpenBLAS is optimized on Loongson 3A quad cores CPU. In sequential optimizations, blocking, hand coding assembly kernel, Loongson 3A special instructions and reordering instructions are utilized. The performance of BLAS Level 3 subroutines exceeded GotoBLAS and ATLAS by about 75{\%} and 17{\%}. Meanwhile, it exceeded GotoBLAS and ATLAS by about 103{\%} and 36{\%} in double precision functions. In parallel multi-threads optimization, this study used interleaved data buffer layout to avoid shared L2 Cache conflictions among multi-threads. OpenBLAS achieved 3.47 speedups on quad cores. In 4 threads, the performance of OpenBLAS BLAS Level3 functions exceeded GotoBLAS and ATLAS by about 69{\%} and 34{\%}, 89{\%} and 55{\%} in double precision functions. {\textcopyright}2011 Journal of Software.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large microarray datasets have enabled gene regulation to be studied through coexpression analysis. While numerous methods have been developed for identifying differentially expressed genes between two conditions, the field of differential coexpression analysis is still relatively new. More specifically, there is so far no sensitive and untargeted method to identify gene modules (also known as gene sets or clusters) that are differentially coexpressed between two conditions. Here, sensitive and untargeted means that the method should be able to construct de novo modules by grouping genes based on shared, but subtle, differential correlation patterns. RESULTS: We present DiffCoEx, a novel method for identifying correlation pattern changes, which builds on the commonly used Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) framework for coexpression analysis. We demonstrate its usefulness by identifying biologically relevant, differentially coexpressed modules in a rat cancer dataset. CONCLUSIONS: DiffCoEx is a simple and sensitive method to identify gene coexpression differences between multiple conditions.},

abstract = {Large-scale "omics" data, such as microarrays, can be used to infer underlying cellular regulatory networks in organisms, enabling us to better understand the molecular basis of disease and important traits. Correlation approaches, such as a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2 experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the DiffCorr package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. DiffCorr calculates correlation matrices for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based "eigen-molecules" in the correlation networks, and tests differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks. DiffCorr can explore differential correlations between 2 conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely transcriptomics and metabolomics. DiffCorr is simple to use in calculating differential correlations and is suitable for the first step towards inferring causal relationships and detecting biomarker candidates. The package can be downloaded from the following website: http://diffcorr.sourceforge.net/.},

@article{Cichonska:2016,
abstract = {Motivation: A dominant approach to genetic association studies is to perform univariate tests between genotype-phenotype pairs. However, analyzing related traits together increases statistical power, and certain complex associations become detectable only when several variants are tested jointly. Currently, modest sample sizes of individual cohorts, and restricted availability of individual-level genotype-phenotype data across the cohorts limit conducting multivariate tests. Results: We introduce metaCCA, a computational framework for summary statistics-based analysis of a single or multiple studies that allows multivariate representation of both genotype and phenotype. It extends the statistical technique of canonical correlation analysis to the setting where original individual-level records are not available, and employs a covariance shrinkage algorithm to achieve robustness. Multivariate meta-analysis of two Finnish studies of nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics by metaCCA, using standard univariate output from the program SNPTEST, shows an excellent agreement with the pooled individual-level analysis of original data. Motivated by strong multivariate signals in the lipid genes tested, we envision that multivariate association testing using metaCCA has a great potential to provide novel insights from already published summary statistics from high-throughput phenotyping technologies.},
